> NOTE (If you have already installed the Annihilation Recreated datapack)
> This datapack will not reset the region where the previous structure was placed. And you will not be able to interact with it anymore (unless you disable the addon)

> [!WARNING]
> This datapack require a ResourcePack, you will find it on the bottom of the modrinth page of the datapack [link](https://modrinth.com/datapack/annir-corrupted-gateway/version/anniR-corrupted_gateway-r1)

## Features

To get in the dimension you will need to craft a `Corrupted Shard`

![recipe](https://github.com/Julien2744/annir-corrupted-gateway/blob/main/image/corrupted_shard_crafting.jpg)

Then drop the item **1 block next to a `minecraft:end_gateway`**

![create gateway](https://github.com/Julien2744/annir-corrupted-gateway/blob/main/image/create_corrupted-gateway.jpg)

After that the corrupted shard will proceed to corrupt the end_gateway and you will be able to enter the dimension.

After entering the dimension you will be granted a map showing the location of a `Corruption Portal` (they are mutiple of them now)

## Know issues
- The dimension/biome is supposed to have giant corruption spike, but I did not manage to make them generate correctly
- Some mob that are supposed to spawn in the dimension/biome doesn't
- The ambient music playing in the dimension/bime isn't the one specified
